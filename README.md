Track – Real-Time Parcel Tracking for a Seamless Delivery Experience
"Track" is a core feature of our full-stack parcel delivery application, built to provide users with a transparent and reliable way to monitor their shipments from dispatch to doorstep.

⚙️ Technology Stack Overview:
Frontend: Developed using React.js, the user interface delivers a responsive, intuitive experience across devices. The real-time tracking dashboard is interactive, showing live parcel status updates and location markers with minimal lag.

Backend: Powered by Node.js, the backend handles API requests efficiently and ensures smooth communication between the client interface and the server. Real-time data syncing is achieved through WebSocket or polling strategies, providing continuous updates without overloading the server.

Database: We use PostgreSQL for robust and scalable data management. Each parcel’s status, history, and geolocation logs are securely stored and retrieved with optimized queries, ensuring fast and accurate data delivery.

🚚 Key Features of the "Track" Module:
Live Parcel Location: See your package move on the map in real-time.

Status Updates: From "Order Placed" to "Delivered", every milestone is tracked and time-stamped.

ETA Prediction: Estimated delivery times are calculated and updated dynamically.

Secure Access: Users can track parcels using unique tracking IDs, ensuring data privacy.

💡 Why It’s Seamless:
The integration of modern web technologies with a high-performance database ensures low latency, high reliability, and an intuitive user experience. From React's dynamic interface to Node.js’s non-blocking backend and PostgreSQL’s reliable data integrity — everything works in harmony to give users full visibility and peace of mind.
